# ChatGPT TTS Grabber

A Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey userscript that **automatically captures and downloads the text-to-speech (TTS) audio** generated by ChatGPT whenever you click the voice playback button.

## ✨ Features

- 🔊 Automatically detects and downloads audio streamed via ChatGPT’s voice feature (including Glimmer and other voices)
- 📥 Captures streamed audio via Media Source Extensions (MSE), even if traditional fetch hooks fail
- 🐒 Works with Tampermonkey or any UserScript-compatible extension
- 💡 Compatible with both `chat.openai.com` and `chatgpt.com`

## 📦 Installation

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (or similar userscript manager)
2. Install the script via [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/) (link coming soon) or from [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/dudebot/chatgpt-tts-downloader)
3. Visit [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) and use the voice playback feature as usual
4. Watch your browser download the audio automatically as `.webm`, `.mp3`, or `.aac` files

## ⚙️ How It Works

ChatGPT uses Media Source Extensions (MSE) to stream TTS audio to its player. This script monkey-patches the browser’s `MediaSource` API to capture and reconstruct all audio chunks, packaging them into a downloadable `Blob`.

This approach works even if the audio is **streamed directly** and not returned as a traditional file from the server.

## 🧪 Known Limitations

- May not work if ChatGPT changes its audio streaming pipeline to an AudioWorklet or encrypted transport
- Audio is auto-downloaded for every playback (no opt-out UI yet)
